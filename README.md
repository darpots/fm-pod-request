## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 'imports' via @use 
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that you can create make things look very different based on the viewport size.  I also continued to try to keep the page responsive and act well regardless of the base font-size used within the browser.  While this is considered a Newbie challenge it has helped to further strengthen my knowledge around how to structure a codebase, and I can see things that I could have done better in previous React based projects. 

### Continued development

I will try to continue with simplifying my code where possible, and expand on my scss knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Regex for Email check](https://emailregex.com/) - This helped me to save time creating my own regex to check the email address.
